  "description": "This lot is a desert island.  It is the first island of the metahamas, known locally as Uno Island.\nIt has a covenant dictating that nothing can be built on the island and it must be left as-is. You can of course drive your boat there, sunbathe, have a bbq, etc.\nNorth Facing View: https://metahamas.com/lots/b2/b2_detail_1_v1.png\nEast Facing View: https://metahamas.com/lots/b2/b2_detail_2_v1.png\nSouth Facing View: https://metahamas.com/lots/b2/b2_detail_3_v1.png\nWest Facing View: https://metahamas.com/lots/b2/b2_detail_2_v1.png",
